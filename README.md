# Data-Analysis-with-YouTube-API

This project is intended to demonstrate an exploratory data analysis of various statistics garned from a content creator's YouTube channel, primarily from a playlist that they have created. Using the YouTube API, I retrieved the videos and their statistics (i.e. view count, number of likes/dislikes, number of comments, upload date, etc), as well as created an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The EDA currently illustrates information about the best and worst performing videos, view distribution, likes/dislikes distribution, and more for the YouTuber JJ Olatunji, since the playlist provided comes from his channel.

The channel_id list contains the ids for JJ Olatunji and Mr. Beast. If you would like to fork this repository, feel free to add more channel ids to that list by opening up a YouTuber's channel, right-clicking and viewing the page source, ctrl+f (or command+f) "https://www.youtube.com/channel/", and copying and inputting the text that appears after "/channel/" in the URL path. Similarly, you can replace the playlist id with one you are interested in by searching for a playlist on YouTube and then copying the text in the URL that appears after "list=", as this would be the playlist id for that specific playlist.
